This project contains examples of refactorings of Java streams to idiomatic Eclipse Collections.

## Refactoring Collections: Making Your Java Streams Leaner, Meaner, and Cleaner
### Description

Looking for ways to optimize your Java applications? Want to see tangible memory savings as well as cleaner, more
readable code? Want to have better, more natural support for the functional programming paradigm?

Eclipse Collections, a drop-in replacement for the Java Collections framework, will do just that!

Eclipse Collections has JDK-compatible List, Set and Map implementations with a rich API, as well as additional types
not found in the JDK such as Bags, Multimaps and BiMaps. Eclipse Collections also has a full complement of primitive
containers, and all collection types have immutable equivalents.

In this session, you will follow a live coding demo of refactoring standard Java code to Eclipse Collections data
structures and APIs and see some of the memory savings you can achieve.

You will also see how Eclipse Collectionsâ€™ ability to switch between eager and lazy versions of the same collection
types makes writing, understanding and debugging functional code in Java easier.

We will demonstrate how richer, yet easily discoverable APIs allow for simplified code and do not require searching
through library classes for features you need. Should you need a stream library class, such as Collectors, you will see
that it is fully compatible with Eclipse Collections. In addition to stock collectors, Eclipse Collections offers a
richer API via its Collectors2 class.

Immutable collections allow for safer, cleaner, mutation free code checked at compile time and without runtime
surprises. With the combination of immutable collections and the rich API you can write better functional code in Java.

These are just some of the ways in which Eclipse Collections will make your existing code more functional, fluent and
fun!
